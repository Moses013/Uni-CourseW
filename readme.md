# Elden Ring Info Website

## Primary Audience
The primary audience for this website is for individuals who are gamers and have heard of the new game Elden Ring but have not tried it out themselves.
The website is here to inform them of the different roles they can play as on the game which indicates to them that the game is an RPG.
 It also informs them on frequently asked questions such as 1. what consoles is the game on  2. if it is free to play etc.

## Site Organization
I started off with a home page with background image ![Queen Marika](headerimg.jpg) of the game with a navbar that had links to all 4 pages of the website. The pages in order are 1. Home 2. Class 3. FAQS 4. Contact Us.
FAQS and Contact Us were put next to each other so that if the FAQS didn't answer the individuals question they could send a query with their name and email.

## Different Screen Sizes
In order to adapt my website to different screen sizes I used
`@media screen and min-width()` and `@media (max-width)`
I added a menuToggler for screens that were smaller than 790px, allowing individuals to open the toggler and preventing the navbar anchors from not fitting on the screen correctly
I also made the font-size smaller for headings and paragraphs on smaller screens so that the text would fit better on the screen.
This makes it easier to read for the audience.

## Ionicons
`<ion-icon class="add" md="add-outline"></ion-icon>`
`<ion-icon class="remove" md="remove-outline"></ion-icon>`
I used ion icons in order to make it seem like you are expanding the faqs to show the answer to the question.
